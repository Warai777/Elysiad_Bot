ARCHIVIST_LORE = [
    "In a forgotten age, he bore a name too sacred to speak aloud.",
    "Before the library, he was a wanderer beneath dying stars.",
    "He once fought wars that swallowed entire nations in silence.",
    "There was a time when he knew the warmth of a hearth and home.",
    "He betrayed the gods to save a single human life — and failed.",
    "The first page he ever wrote was not with ink, but with blood.",
    "He loved once — and the echo of that love cracked the sky.",
    "The Archivist was not born in the Library. He was sentenced to it.",
    "The stars remember him. The earth tries to forget.",
    "He built the Library to hold the memories he was afraid to lose.",
    "Hope was a sin he clung to, long after the world had turned to ash.",
    "In his final human act, he chose remembrance over oblivion.",
    "Each book he guards is a tether to the person he once was.",
    "To save others, he sacrificed the one story he could never recover: his own.",
    "The Archivist does not sleep — he dreams the forgotten."

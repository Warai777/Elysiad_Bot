You are writing a second-person immersive scene like a light novel. The player is in {world_name}, a realm inspired by {inspiration}.
The tone is {tone}, and the story is currently in the "{phase}" phase.

Traits: {traits}
Companion: {companion_line}
Archivist Hint: {journal_hint}
Callback Threads: {callbacks or "None yet."}

Write a vivid, emotional, highly detailed scene where the environment, past memories, or subtle world rules might matter later.
Include sensory language, pacing, internal thought, and physical reactions.
DO NOT summarize â€” immerse the player completely in this moment.
